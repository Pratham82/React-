React Hooks

1. React hooks are used to "hook into" state and lifecycle of method components without using clases.
2.  Previously we used to the class components for accessing states and lifecycle methods
3. Now you don't even need states or lifecycle methods
4. This allows us to use only functional components across the board
5. Hooks also imporove the readability and organization of components
