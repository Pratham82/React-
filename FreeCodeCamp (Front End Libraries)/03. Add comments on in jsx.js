// React: Add Comments in JSX

/*
JSX is a syntax that gets compiled into valid JavaScript. Sometimes, for readability, you might need to add comments to your code. Like most programming languages, JSX has its own way to do this.
*/
const JSX = (
	<div>
		{/* Testing comments */}
		<h1>This is a block of JSX</h1>
		<p>Here's a subtitle</p>
	</div>
);
